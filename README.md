The Traffic Speed Violation Alert System is an intelligent solution designed to monitor vehicle speeds on different streets using IoT-based IR sensors. When a vehicle exceeds the street-specific speed limit, the system automatically sends the captured IR sensor. The system analyzes collected data using machine learning algorithms and stores the results in MongoDB for real-time alerts by making comparative analysis and alerts the traffic administration.
